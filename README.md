# URL-SHORTNER
URL shortener is a tool that creates a shorter version of a long URL to make it easier to share and remember.

 
The system design of a URL shortener can be broken down into several components, including:

- User Interface: The user interface is the front-end component of the system that allows users to input the long URL they want to shorten and displays the shortened URL that can be shared.

- API Server: The API server is responsible for handling requests from the user interface and generating the shortened URL. It should have the ability to validate the input URL, generate a unique short URL, and store the short URL along with the original URL in a database.

- Database: The database is where the short URLs and their corresponding long URLs are stored. It should be able to handle a large number of requests and provide fast access to the data.

- Redirection Server: The redirection server is responsible for redirecting users to the original URL when they click on the shortened URL. It should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent requests and provide fast redirection times.

- Analytics Server: The analytics server is responsible for tracking the usage of the shortened URLs, such as the number of clicks and the location of the users who clicked on the link. It should also provide a dashboard for users to view the analytics data.

- To implement this system, we can use a combination of programming languages and technologies such as Python, Node.js, MongoDB or MySQL for the database, and a web server such as Apache or Nginx. The system should also be designed to handle high traffic volumes, so it's important to use caching and load balancing techniques to distribute the load across multiple servers.

- Overall, the system should be designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure, with measures in place to prevent abuse or misuse of the service.
